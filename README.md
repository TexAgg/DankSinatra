# Dank Sinatra
Dank Sinatra is a Facebook chatbot. He is written in JavaScript (using Node.js) and a smidgen of Python. Type '\help' to see a list of his available commands. He also pushes relevant messages to a database, sends me email updates, and posts weather updates every 8 hours, but new features are constantly being added. I hope to one day make him a full-on source of information, such as Siri (only not as good). Unfortunately, the source code is currently unavailable, but will be posted when this changes.
