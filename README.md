# Dank Sinatra
Dank Sinatra is a [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100010461758967) chatbot. 
He is written in JavaScript (using Node.js). 
Type `\help` to see a list of his available commands. 
I hope to one day make him a full-on source of information, such as Siri (only not as good).
