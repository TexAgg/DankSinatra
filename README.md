# Dank Sinatra
Dank Sinatra is a [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100010461758967) chatbot. 
He is written in JavaScript (using Node.js). 
Type `\help` to see a list of his available commands. 
He also pushes relevant messages to a database, sends me email updates, and posts weather updates every 12 hours and pictures of random trash cans every 8, 
but new features are constantly being added. 
I hope to one day make him a full-on source of information, such as Siri (only not as good). 
Unfortunately, the source code is currently unavailable, but will be posted when this changes.

## Disclaimer
The code is not well written.
This is a personal project mostly meant to familiarize myself with public API's and Node.JS.
Also, every so often I have to verify that Dank is not a bot (by hand) if I login frequently in a short window of time.
